This program contains two functions. The first is a simpler version which will identify the word "bread" in a given text
and return the sentence which contains it. The second is a more complex version which uses a list specified by the user
to scan for a variety of types of bread, and returns the sentences containing each of these.


When the program is run, please follow the format instructions carefully. An example of a correct input is as follows:

filename: my_input
search type: full
list of types: bread,sourdough,ciabatta,rye,rolls,turkish bread,banana bread,wholemeal

I have included in this repository my code, as well as the two text files I wrote to help me test my code. I also tested it on the example files provided.
